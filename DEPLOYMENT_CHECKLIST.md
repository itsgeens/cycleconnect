# CycleConnect Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Setup

### Repository Preparation
- [ ] Add required package.json scripts from `package-scripts.md`
- [ ] Verify `.env.example` contains all required variables
- [ ] Ensure `.gitignore` excludes sensitive files
- [ ] Create GitHub repository and push code

### Database Setup (Supabase)
- [ ] Create Supabase project
- [ ] Copy database connection string
- [ ] Run `npm run db:push` to create tables
- [ ] Verify all tables created correctly

## Deployment Steps

### Backend Deployment (Render)
- [ ] Create new Web Service on Render
- [ ] Connect GitHub repository
- [ ] Configure build settings:
  - Build Command: `npm install && npm run build`
  - Start Command: `npm start`
- [ ] Set environment variables:
  - [ ] `DATABASE_URL` (from Supabase)
  - [ ] `NODE_ENV=production`
  - [ ] `SESSION_SECRET` (random 32+ char string)
  - [ ] `PORT=10000`
- [ ] Deploy and verify backend health endpoint

### Frontend Deployment (Vercel)
- [ ] Create new project on Vercel
- [ ] Import GitHub repository
- [ ] Configure build settings:
  - Framework: Vite
  - Build Command: `vite build`
  - Output Directory: `dist/public`
- [ ] Set environment variables:
  - [ ] `VITE_API_URL` (your Render backend URL)
- [ ] Deploy and verify frontend loads

## Post-Deployment Testing

### Functionality Tests
- [ ] User registration works
- [ ] User login works
- [ ] Create new ride works
- [ ] Join existing ride works
- [ ] GPX file upload works
- [ ] Activity tracking works
- [ ] Social features work (follow/unfollow)
- [ ] Stats page displays correctly

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Frontend loads quickly
- [ ] API responses are fast
- [ ] Database queries are efficient
- [ ] File uploads work properly

### Security Verification
- [ ] HTTPS enabled on both services
- [ ] Environment variables properly secured
- [ ] Database access restricted
- [ ] Session management working
- [ ] CORS properly configured

## Production Optimization

### Performance
- [ ] Enable Vercel analytics
- [ ] Monitor Render service metrics
- [ ] Set up database connection pooling
- [ ] Configure caching strategies

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up error tracking
- [ ] Monitor database performance
- [ ] Check service uptime
- [ ] Review application logs

### Backup & Recovery
- [ ] Verify Supabase backups enabled
- [ ] Test database restore procedure
- [ ] Document recovery processes
- [ ] Set up monitoring alerts

## Maintenance Tasks

### Regular Updates
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated
- [ ] Monitor security advisories
- [ ] Review and rotate secrets
- [ ] Update documentation

### Scaling Considerations
- [ ] Monitor resource usage
- [ ] Plan for increased traffic
- [ ] Consider CDN for static assets
- [ ] Evaluate database scaling needs

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
- **Build failures**: Check package.json scripts match requirements
- **API errors**: Verify environment variables are set correctly
- **Database issues**: Confirm connection string format
- **CORS errors**: Update backend to allow frontend domain
